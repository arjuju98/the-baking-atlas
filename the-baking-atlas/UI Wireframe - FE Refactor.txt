UI Wireframe (Text-Only, Implementation-Oriented for Claude) 1. Global Layout Structure The entire UI should consist of three major elements: Header Bar (fixed at top) Fullscreen Map Container (fills all remaining space) Right-Side Information Panel (initially hidden, slides in when a country is clicked) No page navigation. No view switching. Everything happens in one screen. 2. Header Bar (Minimalist) Placement: fixed at the top, full width. Height: ~56px. Contents: Left: “The Baking Atlas” (text or simple logo) Right: “About” (link to a basic modal or placeholder page) Behavior: Always visible; map scrolls underneath it. No dropdown menus or heavy navigation. Style (descriptive, not CSS): Light background, faint bottom border, low visual weight. Think Google Maps or Apple Maps header simplicity. 3. Map Container Placement: Fills all space below the header bar. Always visible, regardless of panel state. Behavior: Uses Leaflet.js Each country should be clickable. When a country is clicked, the information panel opens. Interactions: Map panning/zooming should not be restricted. Clicking a new country replaces the content of the open panel (no closing required). Marker / Interaction Style (recommended): Hover: highlight border or subtle glow (optional) Click: trigger panel load Avoid floating buttons or popups that link out to “views” Keep the interaction clean: click ? panel 4. Right-Side Information Panel This is the main UI component users interact with. Placement: Anchored to the right edge of the viewport. Width: 33–40% of screen (Claude should choose a responsive value). Height: 100% minus header bar. Visibility: Hidden by default. Slides in from the right with a simple transform animation. Behavior: Clicking a country triggers: Fetch data from the API (/regions/<country>). Render the panel with the data. Panel content scrolls independently of the map. “X / Close” button collapses the panel back offscreen. 5. Information Panel Structure (Inside the panel) 5.1 Panel Header Fixed at the top of the panel. Contents: Large country name (e.g., “Japan ????”) Small region label if applicable (future support) Close button (“X”) at top-right 5.2 Scrollable Main Content Area Use vertical scrolling with spacing between sections. Sections should be rendered using collapsible accordions (simple native or custom). Section Ordering Overview Short description paragraph “What makes this region unique for baking?” Signature Baked Goods List format Each item: name + one-sentence description (Future: linkable detail pages) Key Ingredients Bullet list or tag-style chips Could be grouped (grains, sweeteners, fats, flavorings) Techniques & Equipment Bullet points or short description blocks (e.g., “Black sesame roasting”, “Hot-water doughs”, “Clay ovens”) Cultural Notes Paragraphs or bullet highlights Seasonal traditions, festivals, historical context Starter Recipes (optional field) List of simple recipe titles Link placeholders for now 6. Loading + Error States When a country is clicked, show a skeleton loader in the panel (not a popup). If API fails, show a small inline error message in panel. 7. Animation Guidance Claude should implement minimal transitions: Panel enter: translateX from 100% ? 0% Panel exit: reverse Speed: 180–240ms Easing: standard CSS ease-out Keep animations subtle. 8. Component Breakdown (Claude-Ready) Here is the structure Claude can directly build: <App /> Renders header Renders map container Renders information panel Holds global state: selectedCountry panelOpen countryData <Header /> Static component. <MapView /> Leaflet Map Country click handler: onCountryClick = (countryCode) => { setSelectedCountry(countryCode) fetchCountryData() openPanel() } <InfoPanel /> Props: isOpen countryData onClose Handles: slide-in animation rendering content sections scroll container <AccordionSection /> Used for Overview, Signature Goods, Ingredients, etc. 9. Example Interaction Flow (Claude should follow this exactly) Initial Load App loads Header visible Fullscreen map rendered Panel hidden User clicks a country App sets selectedCountry App opens panel (empty w/ loader) App fetches /regions/JP Panel updates with formatted content User closes panel InfoPanel animates closed selectedCountry resets (optional) User clicks a different country while panel open No close animation Immediately fetch new data Replace content inside panel 10. Non-Functional Requirements Panel must never cover the header Map must never resize when panel opens No page navigation—single view All content must load dynamically based on API responses Must be mobile-responsive (panel becomes full width on small screens) 11. What Claude Should Not Do Do not create modal popups for content Do not navigate to separate pages for country details Do not overlay huge bubbles or tooltips on the map Do not create complex filters yet Do not restructure backend endpoints
