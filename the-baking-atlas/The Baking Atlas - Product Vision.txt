The Baking AtlasProduct Vision — Internal North StarAudience: Project owner (you), future collaborators, AI coding assistantsPurpose: Anchor long-term decisions as The Baking Atlas evolves. This document explains why the project exists, what problem it is actually solving, and why the project is intentionally pivoting from an index-first product to a story-first system.This is not a roadmap. It is a compass.1. Origin & ContextThe Baking Atlas began as a technically motivated project:* A way to practice full-stack development* A way to structure and explore baking knowledge* Initially expressed as an index of baking practices by countryThe early map-based MVP succeeded technically, but revealed a deeper issue:Baking culture cannot be meaningfully captured through flat, country-level summaries.What felt "off" was not missing features — it was missing depth.2. The Real ProblemSuperficial representations flatten cultureMost food and baking resources:* Reduce cultures to lists (top pastries, key ingredients)* Treat countries as homogeneous units* Ignore history, constraint, and lived experienceThis results in:* Loss of nuance* Reinforcement of stereotypes* Little understanding of why baking looks the way it doesBaking is shaped by forces, not bordersBaking practices emerge from:* Climate and agriculture* Migration and colonization* Religion and ritual* Technology and accessThese forces cut across borders and evolve over time.An index alone cannot express this.3. The Pivot: From Index to AnthropologyOld mental model“How do we catalog baking practices by place?”New mental model“How do we understand baking as a cultural system shaped by people, constraints, and history?”This pivot reframes the Atlas as:* A cultural record, not a directory* A learning tool, not a reference sheet* A living archive, not a finished product4. Stories as the Core UnitStories are now the primary vehicle of meaning.Stories:* Allow ambiguity and uncertainty* Capture change over time* Explain causes, not just outcomes* Respect regional and cultural complexityCountries and maps remain important — but as entry points, not conclusions.The map helps you discover stories. The stories help you understand baking.5. Editorial PhilosophyThe Baking Atlas is:* Curious, not authoritative* Pattern-seeking, not exhaustive* Honest about uncertaintyThe project does not claim to define baking culture.Instead, it aims to:* Document* Synthesize* Preserve* Ask better questions6. Community as a Future, Not a ShortcutThe long-term vision includes community contribution.However:* Quality precedes scale* Curation precedes crowdsourcing* Editorial standards precede open submissionThe Atlas earns the right to community input by first demonstrating:* Thoughtfulness* Respect* Rigor7. What Success Looks LikeThe Baking Atlas is successful if:* A reader finishes a story with a deeper understanding than they started* A baker recognizes their own experience reflected with nuance* New contributors align naturally with the project’s tone and intent* The system can grow without losing its soul8. Long-Term Ambition (Held Lightly)The ultimate aspiration is an exhaustive, evolving record of baking cultures:* Past, present, and emerging* Global, regional, and local* Traditional and modernThis will never be "finished" — and that is the point.9. Decision Filter (Use This Often)When faced with trade-offs, ask:1. Does this deepen understanding, or just add surface area?2. Does this respect cultural complexity?3. Does this preserve flexibility for future evolution?4. Would this still matter if the project stopped growing tomorrow?If the answer is unclear — slow down.10. Closing PrincipleThe Baking Atlas exists to make baking culture legible without making it small.This principle should outlive any specific feature, framework, or phase.
