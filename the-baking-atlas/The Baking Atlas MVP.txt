Project Name: The Baking AtlasAuthor: Arjun GandhiDate: November 6, 20251. Overview & PurposeThe Baking Atlas is an interactive map-based web app that lets users explore global baking traditions. Each country (and later, subregions) will have entries describing unique baked goods, ingredients, cultural practices, and methods.The project’s purpose is twofold:1. To help users learn about global baking practices.2. To help me (the developer) deepen my understanding of backend data design, querying, and full-stack integration between front-end, API, and database layers.For the MVP, the data will be read-only and seeded manually by me. The focus will be on building a stable, flexible backend that can grow over time.2. MVP GoalsPrimary learning goal:* Strengthen backend proficiency by designing, building, and querying a structured database.* Build a minimal but extensible full-stack application (React frontend, REST API, and a database).Primary product goal:* Enable users to explore a global map and click on a country to learn about its baking culture and traditions.3. MVP User FlowStep-by-Step Flow1. Landing Page (React FE)o User sees an interactive world map (e.g., using a library like react-simple-maps or Leaflet.js).o When the user hovers on a country, the country name highlights.2. Select a Countryo On click, the frontend makes an API request (GET /api/countries/:countryCode) to the backend.3. Backend/API Layer (FastAPI or Flask)o The API retrieves the relevant country data from the database (PostgreSQL or SQLite for MVP).o Sends the structured JSON response back to the frontend.4. Display Country Data (FE)o The frontend renders the data in a styled modal or side panel.o Categories include:* Country overview* Signature baked goods* Common ingredients* Techniques or tools used* Cultural notes or baking rituals* Sample recipe(s)5. Optional Navigationo User can return to the map or navigate to another country.4. Architecture Overview4.1 Tech StackLayerTechnologyNotesFrontendReact + Vite (or Next.js)Displays map, handles API requestsAPI LayerFastAPI (Python)Handles RESTful routesDatabasePostgreSQL (preferred) or SQLiteStores region and baking dataORMSQLAlchemy (if FastAPI)For schema management and queriesHosting (later)Render / Vercel / SupabaseFor FE + BE deployment4.2 Data Flow (FE ? API ? DB ? API ? FE)1. Frontend: User clicks on a country.? Sends request to /api/countries/{countryCode}.2. API Layer: FastAPI receives request.? Queries database via ORM for matching countryCode.3. Database: Returns structured data for that region.4. API Layer: Serializes and sends JSON to frontend.5. Frontend: Dynamically renders the information (cards, tabs, or sections).5. Data Model (MVP)You’ll manually seed the database with data. Below is a suggested schema that balances structure with flexibility:countries tableFieldTypeDescriptionidInteger (PK)Auto-increment IDnameStringCountry namecodeStringISO 2-letter country coderegionStringGeographic region (e.g., “Southeast Asia”)overviewTextGeneral notes on baking culturebaking_practices tableFieldTypeDescriptionidInteger (PK)country_idForeignKeyLinks to countriessignature_baked_goodsJSONList of items + short descriptionscommon_ingredientsJSONList or dictionarymethods_or_toolsJSONe.g., tandoor oven, wood-fired bakingcultural_contextTextTraditions, holidays, ritualsrecipesJSONOptional starter recipes6. Categories to Research Per RegionYou’ll track and populate data using these categories:1. Country Overviewo Baking history and influence (colonial, trade, migration)2. Signature Baked Goodso Names, flavors, and forms (bread, pastry, cake, cookie, etc.)3. Common Ingredientso Staples (e.g., rice flour, coconut, chickpea, etc.)4. Preparation Methods / Toolso Unique ovens, baking vessels, fermentation styles5. Cultural Contexto Rituals, holidays, occasions tied to baked goods6. Sample Recipeso A few example recipes or notable links (for later)7. Regional Variations (Post-MVP)o Subregions (e.g., northern Italy vs southern Italy)7. Post-MVP ConsiderationsAreaDescriptionTechnical ConsiderationSubregional DataAllow for regions within countries (e.g., prefectures, provinces).Add regions table linked to countries.User SubmissionsLet users submit local recipes, bakery stories, or photos.Add authentication (Auth0 or Supabase Auth) + form endpoints.Media AttachmentsUpload images, bakery interviews, etc.Use cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3, Supabase Storage).Search/FilteringLet users filter by baked good type or ingredient.Add search indexes or tag-based filters.Gamification / CommunityUsers can “pin” visited places or share discoveries.Add user profile + activity schema.8. Development PhasesPhaseDescriptionDeliverablesPhase 1 – Setup & ArchitectureSet up FastAPI + database + schemaWorking API with seeded example countryPhase 2 – Frontend IntegrationConnect React FE to APIFunctional interactive map with country click & data renderPhase 3 – Data ExpansionPopulate data manually for 5–10 countriesShowcases diversity of contentPhase 4 – Post-MVP PrepReview schema flexibility for regions & user submissionsTechnical recommendations from Claude9. Example User Journey (MVP)1. User lands on thebakingatlas.com2. Interactive map loads ? user clicks “Japan”3. Request: GET /api/countries/JP4. Response (JSON):{  "name": "Japan",  "region": "East Asia",  "overview": "Japanese baking blends European techniques with local ingredients.",  "signature_baked_goods": ["Melonpan", "Castella", "Anpan"],  "common_ingredients": ["azuki beans", "matcha", "rice flour"],  "methods_or_tools": ["oven baking", "steam baking"],  "cultural_context": "Many baked goods are enjoyed during festivals and seasonal events."}5. Data displays in a right-side panel with visually clean sections.6. User clicks “Back to map” to explore another country.10. Collaboration Notes for ClaudeWhen starting:* Focus on setting up the backend first (API + database + schema).* Ensure schema is normalized but flexible enough for future subregion and user submission support.* Provide me with simple, readable queries (e.g., how to retrieve all baked goods from a specific region).* Keep the frontend minimal — just enough to confirm data is flowing correctly.
